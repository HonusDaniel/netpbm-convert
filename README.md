# netpbm-convert
Netpbm image convertor. Converts binary and ascii P1 through P6 headers. P7 not supported. I still need to iron out binary pbm conversions.

### Usage
in the terminal run ./netpbm-convert, you will then be presented with multiple text entry fields. Converts images in the working directory.
